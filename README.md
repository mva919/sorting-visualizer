# sorting-visualizer
This is a web app that demonstrates the bubble sort and insertion sort algorithms and how they differ from one another. I built this using react, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project taught me how to use TypeScript with React and how to apply animations to divs in react.

## To-do ##
* Add merge sort
* Disable buttons while sorting
